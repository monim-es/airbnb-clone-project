# Team Roles

Frontend Developer: Responsible for building the user interface and ensuring a responsive, accessible, and interactive experience for users. Works closely with designers to turn mockups into code using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Backend Developer: Handles the server-side logic, APIs, and integration with the database. Ensures that data is processed, stored, and served correctly to the frontend.

Database Administrator (DBA): Manages the database systems used in the project. Responsible for database design, performance tuning, backups, and ensuring data integrity and security.

DevOps Engineer: Sets up and maintains the development pipeline, automates deployments, and ensures that the infrastructure is scalable, secure, and stable.

Project Manager: Oversees project planning and execution. Ensures that the team stays on track, meets deadlines, and communicates effectively.

Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer: Tests the application for bugs and ensures that the final product meets the quality standards. Creates test plans, automates testing where possible, and verifies feature functionality.

UI/UX Designer: Designs the user interface and experience. Creates wireframes, mockups, and ensures the app is visually appealing and easy to use.

## Technology Stack

### Advanced Python and Django
Used for building the core backend functionalities and developing complex web applications efficiently.

### Advanced Shell Commands and DevOps Introduction
Helps automate deployment, manage server environments, and streamline the development workflow.

### Security and Performance Optimization
Ensures the application is secure from vulnerabilities and performs efficiently under load.

### Crons, Caching, and IP Tracking Tools
Used to schedule tasks, speed up response times, and monitor user access patterns.

### Bug Reporting and Network Traffic Analysis Tools
Assist in identifying, reporting, and resolving bugs, while monitoring network activity for performance and security insights.

## Database Design

**Users**: id, name, email, password  
**Properties**: id, owner_id (User), title, location, price_per_night  
**Bookings**: id, user_id, property_id, start_date, end_date  
**Reviews**: id, user_id, property_id, rating, comment  
**Payments**: id, booking_id, amount, status, date  

**Relations**:  
- A user can own multiple properties and make bookings.  
- A booking links a user to a property.  
- Properties can have multiple reviews.  
- Each booking has one


## Feature Breakdown

**User Management**  
Allows users to sign up, log in, and manage their profiles. Secure authentication ensures that each user can access and manage their own data.

**Property Management**  
Hosts can list, update, and remove properties. Each listing includes details like description, location, and pricing.

**Booking System**  
Users can search for available properties, select dates, and make bookings. The system prevents overlapping reservations and tracks booking history.

**Review System**  


## CI/CD Pipeline

CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipelines automate the process of building, testing, and deploying code. This ensures that changes are integrated smoothly and delivered faster with fewer bugs. For this project, tools like GitHub Actions and Docker can be used to automate workflows, run tests, and deploy updates efficiently.

## API Security

To secure the backend APIs, we will implement authentication (to verify user identity), authorization (to control access to resources), and rate limiting (to prevent abuse and ensure stability). Security is crucial to protect user data, ensure only authorized access to sensitive operations like payments, and maintain system reliability.
